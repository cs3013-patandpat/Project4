To test our code, we ran two functions:

[Memory Maxer] is the function given to us in the project spec. It's important that this runs because let's be honest,
				if our code doesn't work with the basic setup, it's just no good. 
				
[Multithreaded Havoc] is the function we have developed to excruciatingly test our code. This code arbitrarily retrieves,
				modifies, creates, and frees pages in 20 different thread (each thread executes each action upwards of 300 times 
				for a grand total of 6,000 operations. We are confident that after testing multiple times with no issues, this function,
				through sheer brute force, tests most edge cases.
